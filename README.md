# Senior Keeper - Bracelet Fall Detection Website

![Senior Keeper Logo](./public/img/LOGO_KEEPER.png)

Senior Keeper is a web application designed to manage the sale and usage of a bracelet that detects falls. The project aims to assist elderly individuals and provide them with a sense of security. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the front end, while the back end is powered by Node.js. The project utilizes a PostgreSQL database to store relevant information.

## Features
- User Registration and Authentication: Users can create accounts and securely log in to the website.
- Bracelet Purchase: Users can browse and purchase the fall detection bracelets directly from the website.
- Bracelet Management: Once a user owns a bracelet, they can manage its settings, view fall history, and perform other related actions.
- Admin Dashboard: The system includes an admin dashboard that allows authorized personnel to manage user accounts, monitor bracelet sales, and access additional administrative features.
